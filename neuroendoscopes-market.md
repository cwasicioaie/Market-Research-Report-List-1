<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuroendoscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Neuroendoscope</li><li>Flexible Neuroendoscope</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neuroendoscope market comprises two main types: rigid and flexible neuroendoscopes. Rigid neuroendoscopes feature a fixed structure, offering stability and precision during surgical procedures on the brain and spinal cord. They are ideal for accessing specific areas but may have limitations in maneuverability. In contrast, flexible neuroendoscopes provide greater versatility, allowing for navigation around complex anatomical structures. These are particularly useful in minimally invasive surgeries where access to tight spaces is required, enhancing patient outcomes and recovery times.</p></p>
